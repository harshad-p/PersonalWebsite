				<h2>Massively Parallel MAX-SAT Solver (Capstone Project)
				</h2>
				<p>The MAX-SAT problem is a generalization of the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. Given a Conjunctive Normal Form
					(CNF) of boolean variables, the aim is to find a boolean assignment to the variables in such a way, that maximum number
					of clauses are satisfied. Some existing algorithms use brute force technique, but they have exponential worst case time
					complexity. Randomization algorithms exist, but many suffer from local minima. This project implements the Seesaw Search
					technique for solving MAX-SAT, which is designed to work on multiple cores of a CPU, utilizing their full potential,
					to improve the efficiency of the search.</p>

				<h2>Smart Home application controlled using an Android App and Twitter API</h2>
				<p>An Android app was developed, which gets the room temperature and ambience using sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi.
					The Pi sends updates to the app for every 'x' degrees change in temperature, as specified by the user. The Pi automatically
					closes, opens, or keeps the blind half open, depending upon the Fuzzy rules provided. The same can be done by sending
					commands to the Pi to its Twitter account using tweets. In addition to this, the app can turn on/off the lights in the
					room, and also provide manual control for the blind.</p>

				<h2>Network Anomaly Detection</h2>
				<p>This project involves Classifiers developed in Java, which can learn and detect whether a previously unseen network traffic
					is anomalous in nature or not. The output of the program (Anomalous or Normal) is based upon the output of a bunch of
					decision trees, and a Naive Bayes Classifier. The mode of the results is chosen as the final output. The Kyoto 2006+
					dataset was used for training the classifiers obtained from http://www.takakura.com/Kyoto_data/data_with_IP/
				</p>

				<h2>Common Solver for different problems</h2>
				<p>This project was developed in C++, and involved usage of concepts like inheritance and template classes to optimally
					solve the water jug problem, Sam Lloyd's puzzle and correcting time on a clock.
				</p>

				<h2>Face recognition using Eigen faces</h2>
				<p>This project was developed in MATLAB, and involved recognizing faces on the basis of Eigen vectors of the image matrix.
				</p>

				<h2>Robot Attack Simulation</h2>
				<p>This project was developed in Java, and involved using concepts of distributed systems, multi-threading, synchronization
					and TCP & UDP communication. It involves a grid of size N x N and an object in one of the grids, which needs to be surrounded
					by an 'M' number of robots, in minimum number of moves, each co-ordinating with each other to avoid collision and optimality.</p>

				<h2>Solving Substitution cipher using Genetic Algorithm</h2>
				<p>This project was developed in Java, and used a genetic algorithm which was able to find more than 8 character matches
					in the deciphering key after running the program for more than 500 generations. A better result was obtained for 0.5%
					mutation or by sometimes disabling mutation altogether.</p>
